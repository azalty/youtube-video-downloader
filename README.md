## Installation
Just download the latest release package: https://github.com/rlevet/youtube-video-downloader/releases/latest

Install and extract the folder. Just run one of the two .exe files and it will automatically detect if you are 32 or 64 bits. If you are having problems, you should consider running the file inside "install this if you have problems"
